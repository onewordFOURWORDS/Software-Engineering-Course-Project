# Setup Instructions!
* Clone the project
* setup a virtual environment so you don't overwrite your global python installs:
  * python -m venv $venv_name
  * Then, on mac or linux:
    * . $venv_name/bin/activate
  * Or on windows:
    * $venv_name\Setup\Activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* flask run
  * If you receive an error about missing packages, restart your terminal, it should fix it. I'm not sure which config file needs to be sourced, I'll update this step later once i figure it out.
